# CoinURL-Bot
Uses iMacro and FireFox to bot any shortened URL's from CoinURL. Just
change the suffix of your shortened links with the javascript (i.e.
http://cur.lv/13l2wi).

It's best to use a VPN and allow the javascript to go thru all the
shortened links. Then change the your Public IP via the VPN and rerun
the javascript.

I am currently testing on Windows 10 to see if I get banned or yield a
profit.
